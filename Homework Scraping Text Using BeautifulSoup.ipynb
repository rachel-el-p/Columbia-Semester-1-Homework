    "## Homework 3 Part Two: Scraping\n",
    "This homework asks you to scrape from three different sources: Supreme Court Decisions, rev.com transcripts, and a more complicated version of Shakespeare (bonus (yay, Shakespeare!!). \n",
    "\n",
    "Please follow the instructions and do the best you can. Look at the tutorial for examples, my answers for Homework 3 Part One, as well as the Beautiful Soup documentation, and any other Python resource (such as Stack overflow). As you get further into this assignment a lot of the trick will be using loops properly and appending information into lists. One of the great ways to carefully use Beautiful Soup is to first use find() to find the first instance of something and search through it. And then use find_all() to get a list of results that you must then loop through and search within.\n",

    "Now it's time to scrape from reality. The Supreme Court posts its decisions in a format that is not immediately data friendly. They have a simple HTML table with some information about the decision, including a link to a PDF that contains the written decision. We won't mess with those PDFs this week, but we do want to transform their tables into something useful to us. \n",

Because it is a commercial site, it is possible that they might have protocols that try to defy/block scraping.

Once all 18 of you begin trying to scrape these pages, their site might take notice, or it might not. More importantly, **be careful about how many times you actually run your cell that excutes the actual request.** As I discussed in class, when you have completed a request for an HTML page, save the HTML file locally. And then never run the request again (if you are scraping pages that are being continually updated that is not an option, but here is it). If you need to take a break and come back to your work, make sure to load in the local HTML file that you have downloaded and not to run request again. For the final multi-page scrape it won't make much sense to do that, but you still could. (I don't anticipate there being a problem for this site. But I have found many coders who are new to scraping run requests over and over way too many times and do eventually get blocked by the site, so it is always something to keep in mind when you are scraping a site. And please DO NOT select \"run all cells\", unless you have successfully requested and saved a page local and then commented out the request. Be careful about running all cells generally--especially while you are first building you code.)"

Facebook exploited teens using powerful algorithms that amplified their insecurities and abuses through what it found was an addict’s narrative. There is a question, which I hope you will discuss, as to whether there is such a thing as a safe algorithm. Facebook saw teens creating secret accounts that are often hidden from their parents as unique value proposition. In their words, a unique value proposition. A way to drive out numbers for advertisers and shareholders at the expense of safety, and it doubled down on targeting children pushing products on pre-teens not just teens, but pre-teens that it knows are harmful to our kids’ mental health and wellbeing.\n",

Well, this research is the very definition of a bombshell. Facebook and big tech are facing a big tobacco moment, a moment of reckoning, the parallel is striking. I sued big tobacco as Connecticut’s attorney general, I helped to lead the states in that legal action and I remember very, very well, the moment in the course of our litigation when we learned of those files that showed not only that big tobacco knew that its product caused cancer but that they had done the research, they concealed the files, and now we knew and the world knew. And big tech now faces that big tobacco jaw dropping moment of truth. It is documented proof that Facebook knows its products can be addictive and toxic to children. And it’s not just that they made money, again, it’s that they valued their profit more than the pain that they caused to children and their families.\n",

In order to hook us, Instagram uses our private information to precisely target us with content and recommendations, assessing that what will provoke a reaction will keep us scrolling. Far too often these recommendations encouraged are most destructive and dangerous behaviors. As we showed on Thursday, we created a fake account, my office and I did, as a teen interested in extreme dieting and eating disorders. Instagram latched onto that teenager’s initial insecurities it then push more content and recommendations, glorifying eating disorders. That’s how Instagram’s algorithms can push teens into darker and darker places. Facebook’s own researchers called it Instagram’s, “Perfect storm.” exacerbating downward spirals.\n",

In the past weeks and days parents have contacted me with their stories, heartbreaking and spine chilling stories about children pushed into eating disorders, bullying online, self injury of the most disturbing kind, and sometimes even taking their lives because of social media. Parents are holding Facebook accountable because of your bravery, Miss Haugen, And we need to hold accountable Facebook and all big tech as well. Again, my thanks to you. I am going to enter into the record a letter from 52 state Attorneys General and from two members of the Youth Advisory Board of Sandy Hook, promise as long as there’s no objection. And I will now turn to the Ranking Member Senator Blackburn.\n",

And as the chairman said, privacy and online privacy, passing a federal privacy standard has been long in the works. I filed my first privacy bill when it was in the House back in 2012, and I think that it will be this Congress and this subcommittee that is going to lead the way to online privacy, data security, section 230 reforms. And of course, Senator Klobuchar always wants to talk about antitrust and I have to give a nod Senator Markey is down there. When we were in the House, we were probably two of the only ones who were talking about the need to have a federal privacy standard.\n",

And here you go, 66% of teen girls on Instagram and 40% of teen boys experience negative social comparisons, this is Facebook’s research. 52% of teen girls who experience negative social comparison on Instagram said it was caused by images related to beauty. Social comparison is worse on Instagram because it is perceived as real life, but based on celebrity standards. Social comparison mimics the grief cycle and includes a downward emotional spiral, encompassing a range of emotions from jealousy to self proclaimed body dysmorphia. Facebook addiction, which Facebook calls, conveniently, problematic use is most severe in teens peeking at age 14.\n",

At least not when that would result in losing eyeballs on post or decreasing their ad revenues. In fact, Facebook is running scared, as they know that in their own words, young adults are active and less engaged on Facebook and that they are running out of teens to add to Instagram. So teens are looking at other platforms like TikTok, and Facebook is only making those changes that add to its users numbers and ultimately its profits, follow the money.\n",

      "                     So what are these changes? Allowing users to create multiple accounts that Facebook does not delete and encouraging teens to create second accounts, they can hide from their parents. They are also studying younger and younger children, as young as eight, so that they can market to them. And while Ms. Davis says that kids below 13 are not allowed on Facebook or Instagram, we know that they are because she told us that they recently had deleted 600,000 accounts from children under age 13. So how do you get that many underage accounts if you aren’t turning a blind eye to them in the first place. And then in order to try to clean it up, you go to delete it and then you say, “Oh, by the way, we just in the last month deleted 600,000 underage accounts.” And speaking of turning a blind eye, Facebook turns a blind eye to user privacy. News broke yesterday that the private data of over 1.5 billion, that’s right, 1. 5 billion Facebook users is being sold on a hacking forum. That’s its biggest data breach to date. Examples like this underscore my strong concerns about Facebook collecting the data of kids and teen and what they are doing with it.\n",

I don’t know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn’t used to deepen divides, destabilized democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies. It also means that millions of small businesses weren’t able to reach potential customers and countless photos of new babies weren’t joyously celebrated by family and friends around the world. I believe in the potential of Facebook. We can have social media we enjoy that connects us without tearing apart our democracy, putting our children in danger and sewing ethnic violence around the world. We can do better.\n",

My job has largely focused on algorithmic products like Google Plus Search and recommendation systems like the one that powers the Facebook newsfeed. Having worked on four different types of social networks, I understand how complex and nuanced these problems are. However, the choices being made inside of Facebook are disastrous for our children, for our public safety, our privacy, and for our democracy, and that is why we must demand Facebook make changes. During my time at Facebook, first working as the lead product manager for civic misinformation, and later on counter espionage, I saw Facebook repeatedly encounter conflicts between its own profits and our safety. Facebook consistently resolve these conflicts in favor of its own profits. The result has been more division, more harm, more lies, more threats, and more combat. In some cases, this dangerous online talk has led to actual violence that harms and even kills people.\n",

It is about Facebook choosing to grow at all costs, becoming an almost trillion dollar company by buying its profits with our safety. During my time at Facebook, I came to realize a devastating truth. Almost no one outside of Facebook knows what happens inside of Facebook. The company intentionally hides vital information from the public, from the US government and from governments around the world. The documents I have provide to Congress prove that Facebook has repeatedly misled the public about what its own research reveals about the safety of children, the efficacy of its artificial intelligence systems and its role in spreading divisive and extreme messages. I came forward because I believe that every human being deserves the dignity of the truth. The severity of this crisis, demands that we break out of our previous regulatory frames.\n",

A company with such frightening influence over so many people, over their deepest thoughts, feelings and behavior, needs real over for site. But Facebook’s closed design means it has no real oversight. Only Facebook knows how it personalizes your feed for you. At other large tech companies like Google, any independent researcher can download from the internet, the company search results and write papers about what they find, and they do.

So I’m going to ask you a few straightforward questions to break down some of what you have said, and if you can answer them yes or no, that would be great.

Most tech companies have systems where they can analyze the data that is on their servers. So most of the focus groups I read or that I saw analysis of were around Messenger Kids, which has children on it. And those focus groups appear to be children interacting in person. Often large tech companies use either sourcing agencies that will go and identify people who meet certain demographic criteria, or they will reach out directly based on data on the platform. So for example, on the case of Messenger Kids, maybe you would want to study a child that was an active user and one that was a less active user. You might reach out to some that came from each population.\n",

When they found out that their algorithms are fostering polarization, misinformation, and hate, that they allowed 99 per of their violent contact to remain unchecked on their platform, including lead up to the January 6th insurrection, what did they do? They now, as we know, Mark Zuckerberg’s going sailing and saying, no apologies. I think the time has come for action, and I think you are the catalyst at action.

Because there are lobbyists around every single corner of this building that have been hired by the tech industry. We have done nothing when it comes to making the algorithms more transparent, allowing for the university research that you refer to. Why? Because Facebook and the other tech companies are throwing a bunch of money around this town and people are listening to that. We have done nothing significantly past, although we are on a bipartisan basis, working in the Antitrust Subcommittee to get something done on consolidation, which you understand allows the dominant platforms to control all this like the bullies in the neighborhood, buy out the companies that maybe could have competed with them and added the bells and whistles.\n",

I asked her how they estimate the lifetime value of a user for kids who start using their products before they turn 13. She a evaded the question and said, “That’s not the way we think about it.” Is that right? Or is it your experience that face book estimates and puts a value on how much money they get from users in general? I’ll get to kids in a second. Is that a motivating force for them?\n",

And I think the question is always what is the correct way to do it, the right way to do it, consistent with our first amendment right to free speech. This committee doesn’t have jurisdiction over the antitrust issue, that’s the Judiciary Committee and I’m not averse to looking at the monopolistic nature of Facebook, honestly, I think that’s a real issue that needs to be examined and perhaps addressed as well. But at least under this committee’s jurisdiction, there are a couple of things I think we can do. And I have a piece of legislation and Senators Blackburn and Blumenthal are both co-sponsors called the Filter Bubble Transparency Act. And essentially what it would do is give users the options to engage with social media platforms without being manipulated by the secret formulas that essentially dictate the content that you see when you open up an app or log onto a website.\n",

And importantly, in the context we’re talking about today with this hearing with a major big tech whistleblower, the PACT Act would explore the viability of a federal program for big tech employees to blow the whistle on wrongdoing inside the companies where they work. And in my view, we should encourage employees in the tech sector like you to speak up about questionable practices of big tech companies.\n",

So let me Ms. Haugen, just ask you, we’ve learned from the information that you provided that Facebook conducts what’s called engagement based ranking, which you’ve described as very dangerous. Could you talk about why engagement based ranking is dangerous?

They’re going to say, “You’re going to get spammed, you’re not going to enjoy your feed.” The reality is that those experiences have a lot of permutations. There are ways that we can make those experiences where computers don’t regulate what we see, we together socially regulate what we see.

When I come to you and say these things, I’m basically damning 10 years in my own work. Engagement based ranking, Facebook says, “We can do it safely because we have AI. The artificial intelligence will find the bad content that we know our engagement based ranking is promoting.” They’ve written blog posts on how they know engagement based rankings dangerous, but the AI, I will save us. Facebook’s own research, says they cannot adequately identify dangerous content. And as a result, those dangerous algorithms that they admit are picking up the extreme sentiments, the division. They can’t protect us from the harms that they know exist in their own system. And so I don’t think it’s just a question of saying, should people have the option of choosing to not be manipulated by their algorithms? I think if we had appropriate oversight, or if we reformed 230 to make Facebook responsible for the consequences of their intent ranking decisions, I think they would get rid of engagement based ranking because it is causing teenagers to be exposed to more anorexia content, it is pulling families apart. And in places like Ethiopia, it’s literally fanning ethnic violence. I encourage reform of these platforms, not picking and choosing individual ideas, but instead making the platforms themselves safer, less twitchy, less reactive, less viral, because that’s how we scalably solve these problems.\n",

As we get into this, I want to first read you a quote that I got from Ms. Davis last week. Here’s what she said during her questioning. “When we do ads to young people, there are only three things that an advertiser can target around: age, gender, location. We also prohibit certain ads to young people, including weight-loss ads. We don’t allow tobacco ads at all [meaning to young people]. We don’t allow them to children. We don’t allow them to minors.”\n",

That it was false. TTP noted that TTP had conducted an experiment just last month, and their goal was to run a series of ads that would be targeted to children ages 13 to 17, to users in the United States. Now, I want to emphasize that TTP didn’t end up running these ads. They stopped them from being distributed to users, but Facebook did in fact approve them. As I understand it, Facebook approved them for an audience of up to 9.1 million users, all of whom were teens.\n",

The second graphic displays an ana tip. That is a tip specifically designed to encourage and promote anorexia. It’s on there. Now the language, the ana tip itself independently promotes that. The ad also promotes it in so far as it was suggesting. These are images you ought to look at when you need motivation to be more anorexic, I guess you could say.

Now, obviously I don’t support and TTP does not support these messages, particularly when targeted to impressionable children. Again, just to be clear, TTP did not end up pushing the ads out after receiving Facebook’s approval, but it did in fact receive Facebook’s approval. I think this says something. One could argue that it proves that Facebook is allowing and perhaps facilitating the targeting of harmful adult-themed ads to our nation’s children.\n",

Right? So the idea that 20% of your users could be facing serious mental health issues and that’s not a problem is shocking. I also want to emphasize for people that eating disorders are serious, right? There are going to be women walking around this planet in 60 years with brittle bones because of choices that Facebook made around emphasizing profit today. Or there are going to be women in 20 years who want to have babies who can’t because they’re infertile as a result of eating disorders today. They’re serious.

You might be showing data that is about the content of their post, but not the post itself. There are many ways to structure these data sets that are privacy conscious, and the fact that Facebook has walled off the ability to see even basic things about how the platform performs, or in the case of their past academic research, releasing inaccurate data, or not being clear about how they pulled that data is just part of a pattern of behavior of Facebook hiding behind walls and operating in the shadows.

You don’t have to struggle by yourself any more. You don’t have to hide these things from us. You don’t have to pretend they’re not problems. You can declare moral bankruptcy, and we can figure out how to fix these things together.” Because we solve problems together, we don’t solve them alone.\n",

Snapchat is about faces and augmented reality. Reddit is vaguely about ideas. But Instagram is about bodies and about comparing lifestyles. And so, I think there are real questions where Instagram would have to come in and think hard about their product or about, what is their product about? And I don’t think those answers are immediately obvious, but that’s why I believe we need to solve problems together and not alone, because collaborating with the public will give us better solutions.\n",

These are people who don’t get protections from integrity systems to see what happens to them. And those people who deal with a more toxic, painful version of Facebook use Facebook less. And so, one could reason a kinder, friendlier, more collaborative Facebook might actually have more users five years from now. So it’s in everyone’s interest.\n",

In terms of should people consent to working with algorithms, I worry that if Facebook is allowed to give users the choice of, do you want to an engagement-based newsfeed or do you want a chronological newsfeed? Like ordered by time, maybe a little spam demotion, that people will choose the more addictive option, that engagement based ranking, even if it is leading their daughters to eating disorders.\n",

Some of it’s dark money. Some of it is very overt, but I guess the point I’d like to make to you personally is that your being here really sends a profound message to our nation that one person can really make a difference. One person standing up, speaking out can overcome a lot of those obstacles for us. And you have crystallized, in a way, our consciousness here. You have been a catalyst, I think, for change in a way that we haven’t seen and I’ve been working on these issues for 10, 15 years. And you have raised awareness in a way that I think is very unique. So, thank you not only for your risk-taking and your courage and strength and standing up, but also for the effect that it has had.\n",

There is an active need for schools or maybe the national institutes of health to make established information, where if parents want to learn on how they can support their kids, it should be easy for them to know what is constructive and not constructive. Because Facebook’s own research says kids today feel like they are struggling alone with all these issues, because their parents can’t guide them. And one of the things I’m saddest when I look on Twitter is when people blame the parents for these problems with Facebook. They say, “Just take your kid’s phone away.” And the reality is these issues are a lot more complicated than that. And so, we need to support parents because right now, if Facebook won’t protect the kids, we at least need to help the parents to protect the kids.\n",

And I came to hear from a lot of smokers, how grateful they were, ironically and unexpectedly, that someone was fighting Big Tobacco because they felt they had been victimized as children. They started smoking when they were 7, 8, 12 years old because Big Tobacco was hooking them. And as we develop the research, very methodically and purposefully addicting them at that early age, when they believed that they would make themselves more popular, that they would be cool and hip if they began smoking and then nicotine hooked them. Now, physiologically, nicotine has addictive properties. What is it about Facebook’s tactics of hooking young people that makes it similar to what Big Tobacco has done?\n",

They want the next like. The dopamine, the little hits all the time. And I feel a lot of pain for those kids, right? They say they fear being ostracized if they step away from the platform. So imagine you’re in this situation, you’re in this relationship where every time you open the app, it makes you feel worse, but you also fear isolation if you don’t. I think there’s a huge opportunity here to make social media that makes kids feel good, not feel bad, and that we have an obligation to our youth to make sure that they’re safe online.\n",

I happen to be a father of four kids, three daughters, two of whom are teenagers. And as you just alluded to, most adults, myself included, have never been a teenager during the age of Facebook, Instagram, and these other social media platforms. And therefore, I think it can be really hard for many of us to fully appreciate the impact that certain posts may have, including, I would add, on a teen’s mental health. So can you discuss the short and long-term consequences of body image issues on these platforms, please?\n",

I’m very scared about the upcoming generation because when you and I interact in person, and I say something mean to you, and I see wince or I see you cry, that makes me less likely to do it the next time, right? That’s a feedback cycle. Online kids don’t get those cues and they learn to be incredibly cruel to each other and they normalize it. And I’m scared of what will their lives look like, where they grow up with the idea that it’s okay to be treated badly by people who allegedly care about them? That’s a scary future.\n",

There are these things called power laws. It means that a small number of users are extremely intensely engaged on any given topic and most people are just lightly engaged.

So, the problems here are about the design of algorithms of AI, and the idea that AI is not intelligent. And if you break up Instagram and Facebook from each other, it’s likely… So I used to work on Pinterest. And the thing that we faced from a business model perspective was that advertisers didn’t want to learn multiple advertising platforms, that they got one platform for Instagram and Facebook and whatever, and learning a second one for Pinterest, Pinterest made radically fewer dollars per user. And when I’m of is, right now, Facebook is the internet for lots of the world. If you go to Africa, the internet is Facebook. If you split Facebook and Instagram apart, it’s likely that most advertising dollars will go to Instagram, and Facebook will continue to be this Frankenstein that is altering that is endangering lives around the world. Only, now there won’t be money to fund it. And so, I think oversight and finding collaborative solutions with Congress is going to be key, because these systems are going to continue to exist and be dangerous, even if broken up.\n",

Last week, YouTube announced it was swiftly banning all anti-vaccine misinformation, and I have long called on Facebook to take similar steps. They’ve taken some steps, but do you think they can remove this content and do they put sufficient resources? We know the effect of this. We know that over half the people that haven’t gotten the vaccines it’s because of something that they’ve seen on social media. I know the guy I walked into a cafe and said his mother-in-law wouldn’t get a vaccine because she thought a microchip would be planted in her arm, which is false. I’m just saying that for the record here, in case it gets put on social media. Could you talk about, are there enough resources to stop this from happening?\n",

As early as 2012, Facebook has wanted to allow children under the age of 12 to use this platform. At that time in 2012, I wrote a letter to Facebook asking questions about what data it planned to collect, and whether the company intended to serve targeted ads at children. Now, here we are nine years later, debating the very same issues. Today, Ms. Haugen, you’ve made it abundantly clear why Facebook wants to bring more children onto the platform. It’s to hook them early, just like cigarettes so that they become lifelong users, so Facebook’s profits increase. Yet, we should also ask why in the last nine years as the company not launch Facebook for kids or Instagram for kids? After all, from the testimony here today, Facebook appears to act without regard to any moral code, or any conscience, or instead puts profit above people, profit above all else.\n",

That’s why we need to expand the Child Online Privacy Protection Act.

Well, it says to all the television networks in America, “Stop praying on children. Stop using all of your power in order to try to get young children in our country, hooked on the products that are going to be sold.” We had to pass a law to ban television stations from doing this. That’s why I knew that after my law passed in 1996, to break up the monopolies of the telecommunications industry and allow in the Googles, and the Facebooks, and all the other companies, you name it, that we would need a child privacy protection there, because everyone would just move over to that new venue. It was pretty obvious, and of course the industry said, “No way, we’re going to have privacy laws for adults.” And they blocked me from putting that on the books in 1996. But at least for children, I got up to age 12. That’s all I could get out of the industry.\n",

The research I’ve seen with regard to quantifiable popularity is that, as long as comments are allowed, so this is not a quantitative thing, this is just comments, as long as comments are still on posts on Instagram, just taking likes off Instagram, doesn’t fix the social comparison problem. That teenage girls are smart, they see that Sally is prettier than them, her pictures are really good, she gets tons of comments, they don’t get very many comments. Right?

When I was a boy, and the salesman would knock on the front door, my mother would just say, “Tell them I’m not home. That man is not getting into our living room.” Well, I would say to my mother, “But you are home.” “Not to him,” she would say. Well, we need to give parents the ability just to say, “No one’s home for you, and your company, and your attempts to prey upon children, to get into our living room.” That’s our moment in history.

So, the good news is I don’t think we’ll have others, but as you may know, you do know, my office created an Instagram user identified as a 13 year old girl. She followed a few easily identifiable accounts on weight loss, dieting, eating disorders. And she was deluged, literally, within a day of content, pushed to her by algorithms that, in effect, promoted self injury and eating disorders. Are you surprised by that fact?\n",

      "                     I just received by text, literally about 15 minutes ago, a message from someone in Connecticut. And I’m going to read it to you. It’s from a dad, “I’m in tears right now, watching your interaction with Francis Haugen. My 15 year old daughter loved her body at 14. Was on Instagram constantly, and maybe posting too much. Suddenly, she started hating her body, her body dysmorphia, now anorexia, and was in deep, deep trouble before we found treatment. I fear she’ll never be the same, I’m brokenhearted. I think people tend to lose sight of the real world impact here. And I think that’s the reason that you’re here. I’d just like to invite you, if you have any words to those other employees at big tech, the workers who may be troubled by the misconduct or unethical conduct that they see, what you would tell them.\n",

      "                     We live in a pattern that we have seen throughout time with regard to technologies, is that humans are very crafty people; we find interesting solutions, but we often get out over our skis, right? We develop things that are of larger scale than we really know how to handle. And what we have done in the past is, when we see this happen, we take a step back, and we find institutions, and we find frameworks for doing these things in a safe way. We live in a moment where whistleblowers are very important, because these technological systems are walled off. They are very complicated. They’re things that you need to be a specialist to really understand the consequences of. And the fact that we’ve been having the exact same kinds of false choice discussions about what to do about Facebook; is it about privacy or oversight? Is it about censorship or safety? The fact that we’re being asked these false choices is just an illustration of what happens when the real solutions are hidden inside of companies. We need more tech employees to forward through legitimate channels, like the SCC or Congress, to make sure that the public has the information they need, in order to have technologies be human-centric, not computer-centric.\n",

    "Last Thursday, the message from Ms. Antigone Davis, Facebook’s Global Head of Safety was simple, “This research is not a bombshell.” and she repeated the line, not a bombshell. Well, this research is the very definition of a bombshell. Facebook and big tech are facing a big tobacco moment, a moment of reckoning, the parallel is striking. I sued big tobacco as Connecticut’s attorney general, I helped to lead the states in that legal action and I remember very, very well, the moment in the course of our litigation when we learned of those files that showed not only that big tobacco knew that its product caused cancer but that they had done the research, they concealed the files, and now we knew and the world knew. And big tech now faces that big tobacco jaw dropping moment of truth. It is documented proof that Facebook knows its products can be addictive and toxic to children. And it’s not just that they made money, again, it’s that they valued their profit more than the pain that they caused to children and their families.\n",
