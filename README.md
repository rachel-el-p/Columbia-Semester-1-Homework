# Columbia_Foundations_HW
A repository containing homework submissions for two of Columbia Journalism School's data journalism coding basics classes, Foundations and Data & Databases.

In these classes, we learned to use libraries, tools, and methods such as pandas, scraping APIs, playwright, PDF scrapers, beautiful soup, SQL, and regex.
